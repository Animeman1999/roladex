## Known Problems, Issues, And/Or Errors in the Program
Internet Explorer has a known bug with displaying properly when using visual studios with dataTables.bootstrap. Should view properly on server, but I have not tested to confirm this. Can confirm the problem when viewing via file is fixed when using PHP on a server.
